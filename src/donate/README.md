## Basic Conditions

Dromara open source community organization has the following basic requirements for donated projects:

- **Projects must be original and cannot be Fork versions.**
- Projects must be complete application solutions.
- Projects must have good code comments and continuously improved documentation.
- Projects must be hosted on the Gitee platform with Stars exceeding 100.
- Projects must have valid code submission records in the past 2 months.
- **Projects must be approved by the dromara community organization's jury.**
- Preference is given to Gitee recommended projects or those that have obtained GVP. (GVP projects need to contact Gitee official staff to cancel GVP before transferring to the organization, and restore GVP after a successful transfer)
- Priority is given to projects in the fields of container tools, microservice frameworks and tools, distributed transactions, distributed middleware, big data processing, artificial intelligence, IoT, and development/testing/operations related tool chains.

## Source Repository Impact

Currently, donated projects are handled by transferring to the dromara organization repository. After the project is transferred, the following impacts will occur:

- gitee ：`https://gitee.com/dromara/repository-name`
- github：`https://github.com/dromara/repository-name`

If there are absolute path references (images, files, etc.) in the project source code, they need to be changed to relative paths.

## Repository Permissions

- The head of the dromara organization will set super admin permissions for the new project leader.
- Project PMC/Committers will be invited to join the dromara organization and set relevant read and write permissions. The project is independently submitted and operated.
- Project PMC/Committers will be assigned emails with the suffix `@dromara.org`.

## Repository Documentation

- In principle, you need to contact the person in charge of the dromara official website and update the transfer document at `https://dromara.org`.

## Version Release

- In principle, the next version is required to change the package name prefix to `org.dromara` and be published to the MAVEN repository.

## Organization/Community

- The head or secretary of the dromara open source organization invites you to join the dromara community group and makes an announcement to all members.
- The dromara open source community's official account releases a welcome article and synchronizes it to the technical community.
- The original repository community group adds the `dromara-xxx` prefix.

## Donation Project Exit Matters (Preliminary Version)

The dromara community organization always has a positive, open and tolerant attitude. If the author of the donated project cannot identify with the development philosophy of the organization after joining the dromara organization or wants to transfer to another organization/person, they can apply to the dromara jury for exit. Exit application process:

1. The project author needs to write the reason for the project exit in writing or email and email it to [pmc@dromara.org](mailto:pmc@dromara.org).
2. After the dromara jury receives the application, they will communicate with the project author as soon as possible to confirm the exit intention. If the author insists on exiting, it will be approved for processing.
3. Please note that if the project applying for exit is a GVP project, you need to contact the Gitee official staff to cancel the GVP and then transfer it back to your personal name. After a successful transfer, contact the Gitee official staff to restore it. Non-GVP projects can be operated directly.
4. After the project exits, the dromara organization will push announcements on major platforms and community groups to inform, and archive the project's historical records.

Finally, we hope that project authors can communicate with us before considering exiting the dromara organization, point out where the dromara organization is doing poorly, so that we can improve and develop together.

## Rights and Organizational Form

1. Each sub-project team within the community shares all open source resources, including but not limited to the organizational brand, community official account, official community, exclusive accounts and channels of mainstream technical websites and media.
2. In principle, each project is self-governing, and the organizational committee is composed of the main person in charge of each project.
3. Relevant decision-making matters of the dromara organization (designating and modifying rules, joining or exiting projects, etc.) need to be voted on by the organizational committee before execution. Daily affairs are handled by the organization's permanent head.
4. After making a decision at the organizational level, each project's management team must unconditionally obey the organization, or cooperate with the work and tasks of other projects, so that the entire organization is consistent in terms of publicity activities, task assignments, etc.
5. The dromara open source organization entered a trial operation from March 2021 to March 2022. This principle is the trial operation guide for the organization. Each sub-project has complete autonomy and management rights during this period, as well as the copyright and actual ownership of the sub-brand of the project, without violating the law, moral principles, plagiarism infringement, and harm to the organization and not having a bad impact on the community and users.
6. During the trial run, the community will establish a formal committee. For the subsequent development of the community, the management and authority constraints of the sub-projects will be officially launched and will

## The dromara committee has the final interpretation right for the above regulations.
